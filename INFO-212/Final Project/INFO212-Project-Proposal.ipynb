    "Our project will serve as an analytical research on the relationships between weather and income levels, weather and crime rates, and income levels and crime rates in different districts of Boston City, U.S.. The project will also investigate the changes in these relationships with respect to date. The main goal of this project is to find whether there exists any connections among these attributes. In order to achieve this goal, the project has taken in consideration these datasets: \n",
    "* District_Corresponding Zips.csv which contains the zipcodes of districts in Boston. This dataset has 15 rows and 2 columns.\n",
    "* Income Levels.csv which contains the information of average income per household in each area based on zipcodes and the population in each area. This dataset has 23 rows and 3 columns.\n",
    "* ProjectWeather.csv which contains the weather information such as min, max, and average temperature sorted by date from 2015 to 2018. This dataset has 1463 rows and 6 columns.\n",
    "* WeatherCrime.csv which contains information about types and descriptions of crimes, their corresponding weather features as well as income levels in each district of Boston. In other words, this dataset is a combination of the above three in conjunction with crime data. This dataset has 320988 rows and 20 columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach will start with data cleaning, followed by plotting the relationships of specific attributes in different datasets, and lastly we will perform graph analytics to figure out the correlations among the attributes. The scope of the project is to analyzing these groups of attributes:\n",
    "* Different Crime Incidents vs Income Levels throughout Districts\n",
    "* Crime Rate\n",
    "* Monthly Incident Count\n",
    "* Monthly Temperature Change vs Incident Count\n",
    "* Top 20 Offenses by Types\n",

    "* Number of Incidents vs Day of the Week and Hour of the Day\n",

    "The first problem that we can solve in this data analytics project is to identify the Boston areas that in the past had witnessed the most crime incidents, and what types. With such discovery, the authorities of Boston City can know where to focus on stopping the crime the most. One of the solutions is to improve the economy or the financial status of the areas, and this project also provides helpful assistance with that via analytical results. Identifying the relationships between income levels and incident counts per district, which is among the main goals of the project, can provide evidence for such case. In other words, this project attempts to find out if weath and poverty is in any ways among the causes of crime in Boston districts. This makes the second problem that our project will try to solve.\n",
    "Additionally, if we do find even a weak correlation between weather and crime, that could be of big help to the authorities. They can prioritise patrolling around based on the weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third problem is to keep track of the crime incidents count throught twelve months of the year via plotting and analyzing monthly incidents. We try to know if there is a pattern here. And this leads to the next problem that we want to shed the lights on which is how weather (of particular periods of months) may influence the ups and downs of the incidents count. If the pattern is figured out, people in Boston can take precautions and raise their awareness of encountering a crime case based on the weather of the day or the time of the year or the destination they are going to travel to. \n",
