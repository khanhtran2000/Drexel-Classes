    "### D. When to Hand In\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Submit your assignment no later than 11:59pm in the due date.\n",
    "2. There will be a 10% (absolute value) deduction for each day of lateness, to a maximum of 3 days; assignments will not be accepted beyond that point. Missing work will earn a zero grade.\n",

    "\n",
    "Grading assignments will be based on several aspects: presentation, correctness and coding styles. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a good comment for each variable, each method, each control branch, and each loop. \n",
    "2. Your method comments must mention the purpose of each parameter, and must be grammatically correct.  \n",
